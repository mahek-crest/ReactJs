1. Create a Redux Store
  . src/app/store.js
  . import configureStore

2.Provide the Redux Store to React
  . Once the store is created, we can make it available to our React components by putting a React Redux <Provider> around our application in src/index.js.
  . Redux store we just created, put a <Provider> around your <App>, and pass the store as a prop
   <Provider store={store}>

3. Create a Redux State Slice
  . Add a new file named src/features/counter/counterSlice.js. In that file, import the createSlice API from Redux Toolkit.
  . export them properly -- each individualy 
  . export slice reducer

4. Add Slice Reducers to the Store

5. Use Redux State and Actions in React Components
